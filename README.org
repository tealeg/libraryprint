* libraryprint
** Introduction

This is a trivial program to take a CSV dump of the Excel file
exported by the "Meine Bibliothek" adroid application, and generate a
series of library book record cards from that data.

The output is a single LaTeX file that containes all the library
record cards (one per page) formatted for DIN A5 paper.

Every record that's visited is MD5 summed, and these sums dumped to a
print log, so that next time this program runs, it can avoid
reprinting the same books (the most common case is that new books will
be added to the application).  I've checked in my sums here to track
them (I'm not expecting anyone else to use this tool, but if you do,
you'll need to use a different file and manage it yourself).

** Compiling the program

=libraryprint= uses the go standad library only.  To compile simply invoke the following from within the root of the cloned repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go build -v .
#+END_SRC

** Usage

To invoke the program you need to prived the input CSV file, the path to store your MD5sums under, and an output file path, thus:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./libraryprint MeineBibliothek.xls\ -\ BÃ¼cher.csv sums out.tex
#+END_SRC

*** Making a PDF from the output

Now you have a tex file, you can create a PDF as simply as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xelatex out.tex
#+END_SRC
